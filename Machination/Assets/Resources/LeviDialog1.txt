Levi : Greetings!
Player : Hello Levi, how are you?
Levi : Tired and sore, it was harder than I had thought moving over here.
Player : Any problems setting up your tailoring equipment?
Levi : Everything would be fine if I had some ale. How could we have forgotten to pack some?
Player : I think we did pack some ale, I can look inside the wagons for you.
Levi : I would appreciate it, you are a kind sir!
